This repository is about the exploratory data analysis (EDA) on titanic dataset.

📊 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Welcome to the Titanic EDA project! This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the Titanic dataset, uncovering patterns in passenger demographics, fare distributions, and survival outcomes. The insights are supported by visualizations and statistical summaries.

📁 Project Structure
- EDA report.pdf – Full PDF report with visualizations and key findings
- notebook.ipynb – Jupyter notebook used for analysis and plotting
- data/ – Contains the cleaned Titanic dataset (titanic.csv)
- images/ – Exported charts and plots used in the report
  
🔍 Key Insights
- Age & Survival: Non-survivors were generally older, while survivors skewed younger. However, median age differences challenge this assumption.
- Fare Distribution: Most passengers paid under $100, with a few outliers exceeding $500—possibly VIPs or premium ticket holders.
- Age Spread: The dataset is right-skewed, with most individuals between 20–30 years old.
- Survival Variability: Both survivors and non-survivors show similar age dispersion, but non-survivors had more extreme outliers.
  
📈 Visualizations
The report includes:
- Age histograms and survival overlays
- Fare vs. Age scatter plots
- Box plots comparing age distributions by survival status
- Correlation heatmaps across key features
  
🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PDF export via notebook rendering
